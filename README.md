## Forked From

### gatsby-starter-typescript

The [default Gatsby starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) converted to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Install the original starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new gatsby-starter-typescript https://github.com/haysclark/gatsby-starter-typescript
```
