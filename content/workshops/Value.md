description: >-
  If you're not putting something tangible into stakeholders' - or better yet,
  users' - hands early and often, you're relying on guesswork to guide you.
  Not a strategy that often leads to success. You and your team will try your
  hand at coming up with the shortest path to value in a fast-moving scenario
  where real-world, real-life issues get thrown at you.
