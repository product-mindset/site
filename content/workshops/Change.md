  As we'll see during the previous hour, knowing how and when to respond to
  change is a skill that's necessary for product teams to master. Nobody said
  it would be easy, however. Humans are hard-wired to avoid change. So how can
  you make it something your teams embrace rather than grumble about? That's
  the $64,000 question, and it's one we'll tackle with you in the last session
  of the day.
