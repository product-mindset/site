Canvas exercises like the Business Model Canvas, Lean Canvas or our version have many benefits: 

**UNDERSTANDING THE PRODUCT **

Who is the customer? What is their problem? How do we make money? What assumptions have been made? See how the pieces are intended to fit together. 

**ALIGNING STAKEHOLDERS **

These sessions help stakeholders discover they arenâ€™t quite as aligned as they think they are. They use words differently, they see the customer differently, prioritize differently and it often goes unnoticed or unresolved.

# How to Use This Tool

Time: 1-2 Hours \
Tools: Worksheets, whiteboard, collaboration software \

1. Draw the canvas on a whiteboard, print it out or use collaboration software like Google Drawings so everyone can see what is being created so they can make adjustments or ask questions. 

2. Starting with the customer segment, have the group share their thoughts about each area 

3. Periodically check to make sure each section works with the other section 

4. Share your canvas with the team and stakeholders. Then review it on a regular basis (monthly or quarterly)
