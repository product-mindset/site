Interviews help us learn our customer’s pain, needs, behaviors, goals and motivation. Done well, interviews help us test our assumptions and create a product that customers need along with an experience they want.

Deliberately avoid anything that might make them feel like they are a research subject in a lab. Try to make sure no one feels like there is a right answer and to leave things open so the person can talk about what’s important or painful to them. Connecting the dots between interviews is a bit more complex when you are less structured but the quality and richness of what you learn is well worth it.

We often ask people to describe a day in the life or the last time they did something. Humans are terrible at predicting our own behavior, you can see it in our failed New Year’s resolutions. Understanding past behavior is more helpful creating products.
