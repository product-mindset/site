How do we define success? Organizations who do well in the software development space are growing faster, more profitably, and have high customer engagement. Why?



Because they understand what customers want: They achieve these milestones because they build features that their customers want. Companies invested in CX are nimble and adapt quickly.

They continuously adapt: Not only do they build the features customers want, they also are continuously adapting and improving those features. They never settle on quality and always look to improve. According to an Aptimize study, there are 10,000 apps in the iOS app store. The Top 100 ranked apps released three times as often as the other 9,900 apps available. The truly elite apps, like Facebook and Pinterest, released updates ten times more frequently than the rest of the top 100. They’re the elite because they are able to constantly improve and provide a better take on what users want through testing and striving for perpetual advancement.

They operate with speed/efficiency: It doesn’t take a large team or a huge budget to accomplish these goals; WhatsApp grew to its level of success rapidly with only a team of 50. This is a perfect example of doing a lot with a little; the biggest requirement is focus and prioritization of what will make the biggest impact on your customer.
