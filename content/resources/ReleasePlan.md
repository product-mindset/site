Release planning helps the team understand how we get new stories or features to market. It also helps us prioritize requests from stakeholders or leaders in the business. A release is anytime you push out new features. Some companies do this multiple times a day but most do it every two weeks for monthly. 

Each release should include features your customers can use. Imagine the email or notice you are going to send out to your customers telling them how you have improved things for them. 

This is a simplified version of the release planning we do so you can get used to thinking about how to break down and order work so you can minimize time to value.

# How to Use This Tool

1.  Have a list of your features/stories handy

2. Sort the stories by most important, things your customer need first.  (Focusing on providing value with each release)

3.  Write down your features on each line of the release columns.

\*note - each release can span multiple sprints
