# HOW TO USE THIS TOOL

* Imagine a representative person in your customer segment. What does this customer look like in your mindâ€™s eye? How would this person describe themselves to others? How would someone describe this person in an email? How would you spot them walking down the street?

* Fill in the triggers, goals and product useage boxes according to the directions on the sheet.

* Compare your inputs with your colleagues and come up with a description of who you think these people are so you can go talk to them to see if your assumptions are true.

* Use these personas when making decisions about what features to build, why and how.
