With a fair amount of options generated that having an intial value and effort rating, you need to focus down to a few that you will spend more time and energy developing. By evaluating your options against a number of criteria for your business you will be able to further narrow your list to find the options worth further investigation.

# How to Use The Tool

1. Have your team refer to the ideas they created and ranked and enter them into the matrix as individual rows.

2. Have each person/group start with the top row and attempt to proceed from left to right through the matrix.

3. If the idea passes the criteria youâ€™ve created for that column, place a plus sign and proceed to the next column.

4. If the idea does not meet the criteria, place a minus sign and immediately move to the next row.

5. Use the matrix to find the ideas with the highest number of plus signs and use the bottom half of the worksheet to begin further developing those ideas.
