# LIVE WORKSHOPS

We created the Product Mindset based on years of experience helping clients
build world-class products, combined with best practices from Agile, Lean
Startup and Design Thinking.

It is a collection of values, principles and practices that guide every action
and decision we take in building successful products. It helps align everyone
on the team and beyond team so they can think, talk and execute as a
tightly-integrated unit.

## WHAT WILL YOU LEARN

* A simple language for product development that teams can share with stakeholders
* How to better understand your customers and business
* Why incorporating customer feedback into the product development process is essential
* How to empower your entire product team to think strategically and add value to commercialization efforts
